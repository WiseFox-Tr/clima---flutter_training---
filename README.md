# Clima ☁

## Abstract 
This project is part of the course "The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart" directed by Dr. Angela Yu. 

That said, I use a different organization for project files inspired from MVC design pattern (even if it's not MVC).
I also change a little bit the screen organization : 
 - an home screen with 2 buttons (one to get weather for a specific city, an other to get weather for current location) & a text field.
 - a weather screen that displays city name, degree, icon weather & a custom message.

### Goal
The objective of this tutorial is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We'll look at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 

### What you will create
We’re going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end of the module, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!

!!! Note that the rendering presented here is the one proposed by LondonAppBewery, and differs a little from the work I did (see abstract)

### What you will learn
- Use the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
- Use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks & understand async / await & Futures.
- Network with the Dart http package, use API & parse JSON with the Dart convert package.
- Handle exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
- Learn about the lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and how to override them.
- How to use the TextField Widget to take user input.
